# data622 - Assignment 3 Overview

### Collaborators:
Haig Bedros, Noori Selina, Julia Ferris, Matthew Roland

### Project Overview
In HW3, our focus was on analyzing the student performance dataset used in previous assignments. Our goal is to apply Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithms using features like hours studied, attendance, and parental involvement to predict student performance. We intend to compare the results of our model to the **random forest** models generated from the last assignment to see which performs better for this particular data. 

# Team Collaboration Guidelines for Python Project

## 1. Clone the Repository
Before starting, ensure you have Git installed. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-name>
```

## 2. Set Up the Virtual Environment
### Create and Activate the Environment
- **Windows:**
  ```bash
  python -m venv venv
  venv\Scripts\activate
  ```

- **macOS/Linux:**
  ```bash
  python -m venv .venv
  source .venv/bin/activate
  ```

## 3. Install Dependencies
Install the required libraries as specified in the `requirements.txt` file:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 4. Launch Jupyter Notebook
Start Jupyter Notebook to work on the project:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

## 5. Project Structure
Familiarize yourself with the project structure:
```
your-repo-name/
│
├── data/               # Store datasets here
├── notebooks/          # Jupyter notebooks for analysis
├── scripts/            # Python scripts
├── requirements.txt    # List of dependencies
├── README.md           # Project documentation
└── venv/               # Virtual environment (not to be pushed)
```

## 6. Working on Notebooks
- Create or edit Jupyter Notebooks in the `notebooks/` folder.
- Use markdown cells for documentation and explanations.
- Save your work frequently.

## 7. Committing Changes
Before making changes, ensure you pull the latest updates:

```bash
git pull origin main  # or your branch name
```

### Commit Your Changes
After completing your work, add and commit your changes:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Brief description of changes"
```

### Push Changes
Push your changes to the repository:

```bash
git push origin main  # or your branch name
```

## 8. Using Issues and Pull Requests
- Use GitHub Issues to track tasks and discuss features or bugs.
- For significant changes, create a new branch, push it to the repository, and submit a Pull Request for review.

## 9. Documentation and Communication
- Keep the `README.md` updated with relevant information about the project.
- Communicate regularly with the team through comments in notebooks and GitHub discussions.

## 10. Exit the Virtual Environment
When finished working, deactivate the virtual environment:

```bash
deactivate
```
